## Overview
Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Database Management System (DBMS) of our Virtual Pet Simulator! This project aims to provide a robust and scalable database schema to support a fun and interactive virtual pet simulation game. From dragons to unicorns, manage your mythical pets and keep them happy and healthy!

## Features
- **User Management**: Securely store and manage user data, including usernames, passwords, and user preferences.
- **Pet Management**: Keep track of various types of virtual pets, their names, ages, and health statuses.
- **Food Inventory**: Manage the types and quantities of food available for pets, including names, nutritional values, and quantities in stock.
- **Activities**: Store different activities that pets can engage in, with details like activity names and descriptions.
- **Skills**: Keep track of the skills that each pet can learn, including skill names and descriptions.
- **Pet-Skill Association**: Record the skills that each pet has learned, associating pets with their acquired skills.
- **Pet-Food Association**: Record the food that each pet has consumed, tracking which pet consumed which food and when.
- **Pet-Activity Association**: Record the activities that each pet has performed, associating pets with the activities they've completed.

## Tech Stack
- **Database**: MySQL - We use MySQL as our relational database management system to store and manage data efficiently.
- **Schema Visualization**: DBML - We use DBML to visualize and document our database schema.
- **Backend**: Node.js (Optional) - You can use Node.js for server-side logic if you decide to implement a backend for your application.
- **Frontend**: React (Optional) - If you choose to create a user interface, React can be a great choice for building a responsive and interactive frontend.

## Installation

To set up the database for the Virtual Pet Simulator, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/virtual-pet-simulator-dbms.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd virtual-pet-simulator-dbms
    ```

3. Run the SQL scripts to set up the database. Replace `username` with your MySQL username and enter your password when prompted:

    ```bash
    mysql -u username -p < setup.sql
    ```

Now, your database is ready to support the Virtual Pet Simulator!
